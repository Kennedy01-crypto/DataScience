# Height-Weight Relationship Visualization

This repository contains an R script (`height_weight_plot.R`) that generates a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between height and weight, along with a linear regression line.

## Description

The R script uses the `ggplot2` library to create a scatter plot from sample height and weight data.  It adds a linear regression line to visualize the trend and includes appropriate labels and a minimal theme for clear presentation.

## Files

* `height_weight_plot.R`: The R script that generates the plot.
* `README.md`: This file (the one you're reading).

## Requirements

* R (version 3.5 or later is recommended)
* `ggplot2` R package
