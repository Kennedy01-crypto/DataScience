# Heart Disease Random Forest Classifier

## Overview

This project implements a Random Forest Classifier to predict heart disease based on various features from a dataset. The model is trained and evaluated using a dataset containing patient information and their corresponding heart disease status.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model selection and training using Random Forest
- Model evaluation with accuracy scores and classification reports
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model saving for future use

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- pickle

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `HeartDiseaseRandomForestClassifier.ipynb` to execute the model training and evaluation.
